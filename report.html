            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project is about implementing a portfolio website that everyone who wants to know more about me can have a good idea. The site serves as a comprehensive representation of my skills, experiences, and personality, allowing visitors to quickly understand who I am and what I can offer.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Three professional portfolio sites that inspired me:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://aliabdaal.com/">Ali Abdaal</a> - I learned about effective personal branding and clean, user-friendly design.</li>
                <li><a href="https://jonbarron.info/">Jon Barron</a> - This site taught me about minimalist design and how to present academic and professional information clearly.</li>
                <li><a href="https://pha-nguyen.github.io/">Pha Nguyen</a> - I was inspired by the clean layout and effective use of white space in presenting personal projects.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>Three ways in which I considered the usability of my site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear layout with clean, minimal font for easy reading and navigation.</li>

            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>Three things I learned while creating my site:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>HTML-only websites are quick and easy to implement, providing a solid foundation.</li>
                <li>Adding CSS can be time-consuming at first, but it allows for much more extensive control in the long term.</li>
                <li>Building a website for myself is an enjoyable and rewarding experience.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>I still don't think videos are appropriate anywhere on my site, so I didn't incorporate them. However, in the future, I might reconsider this decision and explore ways to effectively use video content to enhance my portfolio.</li>
